# The Bayesian Mass Explorer

The Bayesian Mass Explorer project (BMEX) aims to provide a user-friendly interface with both existing nuclear data and on-the-fly uncertainty quantification.
The BMEX masses application is a user-focused web tool that provides a one-stop-shop for quantified theoretical model predictions of nuclear masses and related quantities.
